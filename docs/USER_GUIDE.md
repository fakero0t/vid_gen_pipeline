## The 4-Step Workflow

Every video project follows the same 4-step process. You can navigate back and forth between steps using the visual step indicator at the top of the page.

### 📝 Step 1: Vision & Brief (Chat)

**Goal:** Define your video concept through conversation with AI

**What happens here:**
1. Chat with the AI assistant about your video idea
2. Discuss:
   - Product/service you're promoting
   - Target audience
   - Key messages and selling points
   - Desired tone and style
   - Call-to-action

**Example conversation:**
```
You: I want to create a video for our new smartwatch.
     It's designed for fitness enthusiasts and tracks sleep, 
     heart rate, and workouts. Modern, energetic vibe.

AI: Great! Let me capture those details. What's your 
    primary call-to-action?

You: Visit our website to pre-order.

AI: Perfect! I've created your creative brief.
```

**When ready:**
- Click **"Continue to Mood Selection"** to proceed to Step 2

**Your progress saves automatically** - you can return to this step anytime.

---

### 🎨 Step 2: Mood Selection

**Goal:** Choose the visual style for your video

**What happens here:**
1. AI generates **3 mood boards** based on your creative brief
2. Each mood board shows:
   - A sample image reflecting the style
   - Mood name (e.g., "Energetic Neon", "Minimalist Clean")
   - Style description
3. Preview each option
4. Select the mood that best matches your vision

**Tips:**
- Take your time - this choice affects all scene visuals
- Consider your brand guidelines
- Think about your target audience's preferences

**When ready:**
- Click **"Continue to Storyboard"** to proceed to Step 3

---

### 🎬 Step 3: Scene Storyboard

**Goal:** Generate and refine your video scenes

**What happens here:**

AI creates **5-7 scenes** (~5 seconds each) following this narrative structure:
1. **Hook** (3-4s): Attention-grabbing opening
2. **Intro** (4-6s): Introduce your product/service
3. **Features** (12-16s): Highlight key benefits
4. **Call-to-Action** (4-6s): Drive viewer action

#### Progressive Scene Workflow

Each scene goes through **3 states**:

##### 1. ⚪ Text State (Initial)
- AI generates scene description text
- **Actions you can take:**
  - ✏️ **Edit** - Modify the text manually
  - 🔄 **Regenerate** - Ask AI to create new text
  - ✅ **Approve** - Generate image from this text

##### 2. 🟡 Image State (After approving text)
- AI generates a still image based on the text
- Image uses your selected mood's style
- **Actions you can take:**
  - 🔄 **Regenerate Image** - Create a new image
  - ⏱️ **Adjust Duration** - Change scene length (1-10s)
  - ✅ **Approve** - Generate video from this image

##### 3. 🟢 Video State (After approving image)
- AI generates animated video from the image
- Video duration matches your setting
- **Actions you can take:**
  - 🔄 **Regenerate Video** - Create a new video clip
  - ⏱️ **Adjust Duration** - Change length (regenerates video)

#### Scene Timeline

- Color-coded circles show each scene's progress
- Click any circle to jump to that scene

  - 🟢 Green = Has video (complete)
  - 🔴 Red = Error (regenerate needed)

#### Additional Options

- **Preview All** - Watch all completed scenes in sequence

**When ready:**
- Once all scenes have videos (🟢), click **"Generate Final Video"**
- Proceed to Step 4: Final Composition

⏱️ **Generation Times:**
- Text: Instant
- Images: ~10-30 seconds each
- Videos: ~1-2 minutes each
- Updates happen in real-time (you'll see progress automatically)

### 🎵 Step 4: Final Composition

**Goal:** Generate your complete 30-second video

**What happens here:**
1. **Audio Generation:**
   - AI creates background music matching your mood
   - Upbeat, royalty-free soundtrack
   - 30 seconds in length

2. **Video Composition:**
   - All scene videos are stitched together
   - Audio is synced with the video
   - Smooth transitions between scenes
   - Final format: MP4, 1080×1920 (vertical for social media)

3. **Download:**
   - Once complete, download your video

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results

#### Step 1: Vision & Brief

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Image generation failed"
**Cause:** Content policy violation or API timeout  
**Solution:**
1. Edit the scene text to be less explicit/violent
2. Click "Regenerate Image" to try again
3. If persistent, regenerate the text first

#### "Video generation is taking forever"
**Cause:** Video generation typically takes 1-2 minutes  
**Solution:**
1. Check the scene timeline - color should be yellow (🟡)
2. Wait for real-time update (no refresh needed)
3. If stuck >5 minutes, regenerate the video

#### "My project disappeared"
**Cause:** Projects are stored in browser localStorage  
**Solution:**
- Check if you're in the same browser
- Check if browser data was cleared
- Projects don't sync across devices (yet)

#### "Can't continue to next step"
**Cause:** Required information missing  
**Solution:**
- **Step 1→2:** Need a creative brief (have conversation with AI)
- **Step 2→3:** Need to select a mood
- **Step 3→4:** All scenes need videos (🟢 green)

#### "SSE connection failed" message
**Cause:** Network issue with real-time updates  
**Solution:**
- App will automatically poll for updates instead
- No action needed - updates will still appear
- Refresh page if scenes stop updating

#### "Scene is stuck in error state" (🔴)
**Cause:** Generation failed  
**Solution:**
1. Click the regenerate button for that specific state
2. If in text state: Edit text and regenerate
3. If in image/video state: Go back and modify text
4. Check error message displayed in the scene card
